    <h2>Personnel profile</h2>

    <div class="profile">I enjoy working with my hands and seeing how things work. My journey into Programming dates back to my
      childhood when I was very interested in robotics, but at that time there wasn't that much information
      on the subject and now I have the chance. Prosthetics is also one of my interests, it is a branch of robotics that can
      help alot of people.</p>
